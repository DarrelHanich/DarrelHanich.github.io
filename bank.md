# Fiscal Responsibility: Which Countries Have it and Which do not?

<img src="images/World Bank Image.jpg?raw=true"/>

We all hear about being fiscally responsible.  We also know about the need to budget and spend within our limits.  Do countries follow it? Or are there countries that do not understand those principles.
<br><br>
This would be important to know.  This would allow governments to know which countries can pay their debts, as well as save for future needs.  This also lets us know which countries are spending wisely.
<br><br>
Data was collected from the latest snapshot, dated 1/31/2024, from the World Bank data set, found on the bankâ€™s website.  I used CSVFiddle.io to query and view the different results.
<br><br>

This shows the query that was used to show the top 15 countries that do not borrow from the World Bank.  This may suggest that these countries either do not want to borrow money or are using other means to pay their bills.

This query shows the Top Countries that borrow the least or do not borrow at all.  These countries show that when they borrow money, for those that do, they repay the debt.  This shows that these countries desire fiscal responsibility.

This query shows the top 15 biggest spenders.  By sorting the list this way, we see the big spenders.  They may also be fiscally responsible but borrowing a lot of money and being able to pay it back, does show a level of irresponsibility as they are not trying to live within the money that they bring in as revenue.

Here we see how the Dominican Republic is doing.  They show that they get the loans and then repay them in a timely manner.  These loans were taken out in 1971, so this may be suggesting that they are using other means to borrow money or are spending only what they bring in as revenue.  I have a personal interest in the DR as I lived there for 2 years as a young adult.
