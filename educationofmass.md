### Status of the Education System of Massachusetts in 2017

### 1. Report
<br><br>
Education matters for many people.  In fact, after NCLB and ESSA, some of the recent education acts enacted in Congress, there had been an effort to improve the education system to get the US on par with the rest of the world.  However, how is the system doing.  What can be done to improve it if it is not doing well.   I have kids that are in the system.  As a result, seeing how the system is doing matters to me.
<br><br>
In an effort to analyze this question, data was found on Kaggle.  It came from Massachusetts.  This data was from 2017, but it shows an interesting picture.  The Office of the Superintendent of Public Education for Massachusetts asked me to evaluate this data and get some results.  What follows is what I found.
<br><br>
**The Findings**
<br><br>
1.	There are almost 1,000,000 students in Massachusetts in 2017.
2.	There are over 1,800 schools in Massachusetts.
3.	There is a relationship between class size and attendance at college, which defies logic and commonly held ideas.
4.	Many districts are doing well on the standardized tests, at least for Grade 4 students.
5.	There are a number of High Schools that do not have good graduation rates.
<br><br>
**Analysis**
<br><br>
As far as the high schools are concerned, there are 31 high schools that have a less than 50% graduation rate.  This is troubling.  Further analysis as to why needs to be addressed.
<br><br>	
The relationship between class size and percentage of students attending college shows that the larger class sizes have a higher proportion of students attending college.  That goes contrary to the commonly held idea that smaller classes would lead to better graduation rates.  When you look at the color for the dots, the darker dots show economic disadvantage percentages.  The darker the dot, the higher the percentage.  
<br><br>
In 4th grade math, 74 districts meet the 50% passing mark, which includes passing and advanced status.
<br><br> 
**Summary**
<br><br>
In summary, we see that larger class sizes has a better chance of attending college.  We also see that there are some high schools that need to work on improving their graduation rates.  We also see that a number of districts in Massachusetts should try to focus on helping students pass the assessments as well as teach quality material.  Further assessment is needed to determine root causes of some of these issues.
<br><br>
Parents should be aware of this data and results.  This may influence where kids go to school.  I find education data very interesting.  I would love to talk more about this project and also explain ideas that I have on this.  Please contact me for more information and to talk about opportunities to do analysis like this.
